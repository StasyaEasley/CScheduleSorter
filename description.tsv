Visualization allows us to perceive relationships, patterns, and trends. While statistical techniques may determine correlations among the data, visualization helps us frame what questions to ask. Providing efficient and effective data visualization is a difficult challenge in many real world examples. One challenge lies in developing algorithmically efficient methods to visualize large and complex data sets.	None	Graduate	 Fall	Regular Grades	Lecture        Required	None

CSC 580	Students will learn why machine learning is a fundamentally different way of writing computer programs from traditional programming, and why this is often an attractive way of solving practical problems. Machine learning is all about automatic ways for computers to collect and/or adapt to data to make better predictions and decisions or gain insight; students will learn both advantages and unique risks that this approach offers. They will learn the fundamental frameworks, computational methods, and algorithms that underlie current machine learning practice, and how to derive and implement many of them.
